# Document Sharing App



This application is built using Java, XML and Firebase. This project aims to introduce mobile-based file sharing through Android.

Document Sharing App is an Android Application that is aimed at easing the task of sharing documents and other information between its users. Users can log in from their respective credentials to access the application. In general, the user can create a group that holds all the files. Creating separate groups separates different kinds of files from each other so they can be properly managed instead of all files in one place. The users here can upload different kinds of files such as PDF, image, audio, video, zip, etc.

The user can also change or remove the files that they uploaded as desired. Users can download the files that are of use to them through their Android devices.
